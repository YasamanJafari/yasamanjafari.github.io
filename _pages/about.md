Hi! I am Yasaman Jafari, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I am very fortunate to be part of the [BergLab](https://icebergnlp.github.io/), working with [Dr. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~tberg/). Before that, I received my B.Sc. Degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en). My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Generative Models. 

Feel free to email me at yajafari [at] ucsd [dot] edu!
