Hi! I am Yasaman Jafari, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. I am very fortunate to be part of the BergLab, working with Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick.

Before that, I received my B.Sc. Degree in Computer Engineering from the  University of Tehran.

My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Deep Generative Models.

Feel free to email me at yajafari [at] ucsd [dot] edu!
